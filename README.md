# Integer-Set-with-Sorting
This Java project defines a SetInt class to store unique integers with methods for adding, checking membership, and sorting using insertion sort. Users input positive numbers, and a negative value stops input. The program then displays the set before and after sorting, showcasing basic data structure operations.
